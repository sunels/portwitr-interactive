# portwitr-interactive

**Interactive terminal-based port, process, file, and resource inspector for Linux**

`portwitr-interactive` is a high-performance, **curses-based Terminal User Interface (TUI)** designed to give you **instant visibility and control** over your Linux system — all from a single, interactive view.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Live port listing** using `ss`
- ⚡ Shows **CPU% / MEM% usage** per process
- 🧠 Maps **PORT → PID → PROGRAM**
- ⛔ **Firewall toggle** for selected port (temporarily block/unblock traffic)
- 📂 Displays **all open files** of the selected process (`/proc/<pid>/fd`)
- 🧾 Deep inspection via **`witr --port`**
- 🖥️ Fully interactive **terminal UI (curses)**
- ⚡ Real-time refresh
- 🛑 Stop a **process or systemd service** directly from the UI (with confirmation)
- 📝 Warnings annotation (e.g., suspicious working directory is flagged but explained)
- 🛠️ **Action Center (Modal)** — quick operational panel for ports & processes (see below)
- 💥 **Kill Connections** operation implemented (Action Center → Kill Connections): list and kill established connections for a port (sudo may be required)
- 🚫 **Block IP** operation (Action Center → Block IP): block a source IP for a port via iptables (sudo required)
- 🧩 Modal UX: monospace, standard curses box(), 2-space padding, reverse+bold highlights, single‑key selection, ESC to close each modal

---

It enables you to seamlessly navigate the full relationship between:

> **Open ports → owning processes → CPU & memory usage → firewall rules → files in use**

This eliminates the need to jump between multiple tools such as `ss`, `netstat`, `lsof`, `top`, or firewall utilities.

## Core Navigation

```text
portwitr
├─ 🌐 Ports              View all open ports and their states
├─ ⚡ Usage (CPU/Mem)    Real-time resource consumption per process
├─ 🧠 Processes          Process inspection and ownership mapping
├─ ⛔ Firewall Toggle    Enable/disable firewall rules interactively
└─ 📂 Open Files         Files and sockets used by each process
```
---

## 🧠 What Makes It Special?

Unlike classic tools that show *only one layer* (`ss`, `netstat`, `lsof`),  
**portwitr-interactive connects everything together**:

🔌 **Port** → ⚡ **CPU/MEM Usage** → 🧠 **Process / Service** → ⛔ **Firewall Control** → 📂 **All open files**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Port discovery**
    - `ss -lntuHp`
2. **Process resolution**
    - Extracts PID & program name from socket metadata
3. **CPU/Mem usage**
    - Uses `ps -p <pid> -o pcpu=,pmem=` for human-readable metrics
4. **Open file inspection**
    - Reads `/proc/<pid>/fd`
5. **Deep context**
    - Calls `witr --port <port>` and annotates warnings
6. **Control**
    - Optional process / service stop via `systemctl` or `kill`
    - Temporary firewall block/unblock via F key

---

## 🧪 Requirements

- 🐧 **Linux only**
- 🐍 Python **3.6+**
- Required system tools:
    - `ss` (iproute2)
    - `systemctl`
    - `/proc` filesystem
    - `witr` (**mandatory**)
    - `ps`
    - `iptables` / `ufw` (for firewall toggle)
- 🔐 `sudo` access required for:
    - `witr`
    - stopping processes/services
    - firewall rule management
    - full `/proc` visibility

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunels/portwitr-interactive.git
cd portwitr-interactive
python3 portwitr_interactive.py
```

## 🛠 Action Center (Interactive Operations)

Press `a` from the main screen to open the Action Center modal — a compact two-column modal grouping common operational actions for ports and processes.

UI / behavior highlights
- Monospace rendering inside curses; bordered window uses curses box().
- Padding: 2 spaces internal; text kept away from borders.
- Highlighting: reverse + bold for flash feedback (150–200ms) when a key is pressed.
- Single-key control: press the shown single-letter key (e.g., `b`) — no Enter or mouse required.
- ESC closes the topmost modal; each modal closes independently. When the modal stack is empty the main screen is redrawn (same effect as pressing `r`).
- All actions run inside the same curses process and provide immediate feedback.

Action Center layout (icons mirror the UI)
- Left column — 🌐 PORT OPERATIONS
  - 🚫  [b] Block IP
  - 💥  [k] Kill Connections — lists active ESTABLISHED connections (select 1..9 to kill)
  - 🚦  [l] Connection Limit (planned)
- Right column — 🧠 PROCESS OPERATIONS
  - ⚡  [h] Reload (SIGHUP)
  - 💀  [9] Force Kill (SIGKILL)
  - ⏸  [p] Pause Process
  - ▶  [c] Continue Process
  - 🐢  [n] Renice
  - 🔄  [r] Restart Service
  - ☠  [o] Adjust OOM Score
  - 🐞  [d] Debug Dump

## 🚫 Block IP — details

Invoked from Action Center via `[b]`:

- Two ways to choose an IP:
  1. Select from "Top connections" list (single-key 1..8). Selection flashes briefly and executes immediately.
  2. Manual entry: press `m` to start manual input, type the IP (digits, `.` for IPv4, `:` and hex for IPv6 allowed), Backspace supported, press `x` to execute.
- Validation:
  - Uses Python's `ipaddress` module for final validation before applying rules.
  - Textual length limits applied (reasonable max for IPv4/IPv6) to reject obviously invalid submissions.
- Execution:
  - Blocks via iptables (sudo) using a DROP rule limited to the selected port.
  - The UI updates a local cache of blocked IPs and shows that list inside the modal under "⛔ Blocked IPs".
  - After a successful block the application requests a full refresh (same behavior as pressing `r`) so the main view reflects changes immediately.
- Safety notes:
  - Blocking requires sudo and iptables — ensure appropriate privileges.
  - Actions are immediate and affect live traffic; use with care.

## UI / Implementation notes

- Modal sizing is responsive to terminal size and has been widened to reduce text wrapping compared to earlier versions.
- Feedback messages are shown using a short non-blocking centered message overlay (no need to press an extra key to continue).
- The "Block IP" modal uses emoji/iconography to make options clearer and more visible in the TUI.

---

## ⚠️ Safety Notes (expanded)

- Destructive actions (stop, kill, firewall changes) require explicit keys; confirmation dialogs are used for stop operations.
- Blocking via iptables is immediate—this tool does not create persistent firewall rules across reboots.
- Non-root usage limits visibility; some operations require sudo.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

- ❌ No reinvention of system tools
- ✅ Built on **native Linux introspection**
- 🔍 Read-only by default (except explicit stop/firewall actions)
- 🎯 Optimized for:
    - “Port already in use” debugging
    - Security inspection
    - DevOps / SRE diagnostics
    - Understanding legacy systems

## 🛠 Performance / Startup caching
- The TUI now eagerly preloads heavy data (witr output, connection lists, open-files and per-PID usage) for all discovered ports during the splash/startup phase. This means:
  - First launch may take a little longer (splash progress shows updates), but subsequent scrolling is instant because data is read from in-memory caches.
  - The UI operates on a read-only "snapshot" taken at startup — no heavy system commands are executed while you scroll. If you need fresh data, press `r` to refresh (re-takes the snapshot).
- You can tune caching TTL constants in the source (USAGE_TTL, FILES_TTL, PARSE_TTL, WITR_TTL, CONN_TTL) to balance freshness vs. UI responsiveness.
